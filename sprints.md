### üöÄ Sprint 0: Foundation & Discovery

**Goal:** Set up the project, define the technical architecture, and finalize the user experience (UX) flow. This sprint involves planning rather than coding features.

* **Key Tasks:**
    * **Architecture:** Define the specific APIs for Gemini, Nano Banana, Veo, Chirp/TTS, and Lyria. Determine the exact data formats for each input and output (e.g., What does the "story board" from Nano Banana look like? A JSON file? A series of prompts?).
    * **UX/UI:** Create wireframes and mockups for the main application interface, focusing on the "Video Editor" component where users will assemble and review the final ad.
    * **Setup:** Initialize the code repository, set up the CI/CD pipeline, and establish development and staging environments.
    * **Backlog Grooming:** Write and estimate the initial user stories for the first few sprints.

### üèÉ Sprint 1: Core Input & Storyboarding

**Goal:** Build the first step of the chain. A user can input their brief and receive a storyboard.

* **Key Features / User Stories:**
    * As a user, I want a simple form to input my "brand guidelines," "protagonist," and "product narrative."
    * As a system, I want to take the user's input and send it to the **Gemini** API.
    * As a system, I want to receive the output from Gemini and automatically pass it as input to the **Nano Banana** API.
    * As a user, I want to see the "story board" output from Nano Banana displayed in the application.

### üé¨ Sprint 2: Visual Asset Generation

**Goal:** Generate the raw video "clips" based on the storyboard.

* **Key Features / User Stories:**
    * As a system, I want to parse the "story board" (from Sprint 1) into individual scenes or prompts.
    * As a system, I want to call the **Veo** API for each scene to generate a video "clip."
    * As a system, I want to store the generated clips (e.g., in a cloud storage bucket) and link them to the user's project.
    * As a user, I want to see a gallery of all the generated clips from Veo.

### üîâ Sprint 3: Audio Asset Generation

**Goal:** Generate the "voice over" and "score" in parallel to the video generation.

* **Key Features / User Stories:**
    * As a system, I want to identify the script from the storyboard/narrative and send it to the **Chirp / Gemini TTS** API.
    * As a system, I want to receive and store the "voice over" audio file.
    * As a system, I want to send the mood, theme, or description (from the Gemini output) to the **Lyria** API.
    * As a system, I want to receive and store the "score" (music file).
    * As a user, I want to be able to preview (play) the generated voice over and score.

### üß© Sprint 4: The "Video Editor" MVP (First Assembly)

**Goal:** Automatically assemble all generated assets into a single "final ad." This is the first end-to-end version.

* **Key Features / User Stories:**
    * As a user, I want a "Video Editor" view that loads all my assets: clips from Veo, voice over from Chirp, and score from Lyria.
    * As a system, I want to build a "stitching" service that automatically sequences the video clips in the correct order (based on the storyboard).
    * As a system, I want to overlay the "voice over" and "score" onto the stitched video track.
    * As a user, I want to press a "Render" button and get a single "final ad" video file (e.g., an MP4) that I can watch.

### ‚ú® Sprint 5: Adding User Interaction

**Goal:** Empower the user to edit and refine the AI-generated ad. This moves the "Video Editor" from a viewer to an actual editor.

* **Key Features / User Stories:**
    * As a user, I want to see a simple timeline view of my clips, VO, and music.
    * As a user, I want to be able to **drag and drop** to re-order the video clips.
    * As a user, I want to be able to adjust the volume of the "voice over" and the "score" independently.
    * As a user, I want to be able to "regenerate" a single clip (re-run Veo) if I don't like it.
    * As a user, I want to be able to "re-render" the final ad after making my changes.

###  polish Sprint 6: Polish & Export

**Goal:** Finalize the core experience, add polishing features, and allow for exporting the final ad.

* **Key Features / User Stories:**
    * As a user, I want to be able to add simple **text overlays** (e.g., a title or call-to-action) to the video.
    * As a user, I want to be able to choose simple **transitions** (like "fade" or "cut") between clips.
    * As a user, I want to be able to export my "final ad" in different aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9 for YouTube, 9:16 for stories).
    * As a team, I want to conduct performance testing on the full end-to-end generation pipeline.
