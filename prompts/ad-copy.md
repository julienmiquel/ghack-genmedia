## The 7 Gemini Prompts for Ad Copy

### 1. Testimonial Ad Copy
This prompt transforms customer testimonials into compelling ad copy that builds trust and credibility with potential customers. It takes existing customer feedback and turns it into a persuasive copy that highlights specific benefits while addressing common objections. Use this when you have strong customer testimonials but need help turning them into effective ads that feel natural rather than overly promotional.

> The Prompt: I need to create compelling testimonial-based ad copy for [platform – e.g., Facebook, Google Ads, Instagram]. My business is [business type/industry] selling [product/service] to [target audience]. I have a customer testimonial that says: “[insert actual customer quote]” from [customer name/title/company if applicable]. Create 3 variations of ad copy that: incorporates this testimonial authentically, highlights the specific benefit mentioned ([key benefit from testimonial]), addresses the main pain point this customer faced before using our solution ([customer’s original problem]), includes a clear call-to-action for [desired action – e.g., “sign up,” “shop now,” “learn more”], maintains a [tone – e.g., professional, conversational, inspiring] tone, and fits within [character limit if applicable]. Each variation should emphasize different aspects: credibility and trust, emotional connection, and specific results achieved. Include suggestions for accompanying visuals that would enhance each variation.

### 2. Seasonal/Holiday Promotion Ad Copy
This prompt creates relevant ad copy that connects your products or services to seasonal moments and holiday emotions. It helps you tap into the natural buying momentum of holidays while avoiding clichéd seasonal messaging that feels forced or generic. Use this for holiday sales, seasonal product launches, or any time-sensitive promotions where you want to create urgency.

> The Prompt: I’m creating seasonal promotional ad copy for [specific holiday/season] targeting [platform]. My business sells [product/service] to [target demographic]. Our promotion offers [specific offer – e.g., “25% off,” “buy one get one,” “free shipping”]. Create ad copy variations that: naturally incorporate [holiday/season] themes without being cliché, emphasize the urgency of this limited-time offer ending on [end date], connect our [product/service benefits] to [holiday-specific needs/emotions – e.g., “gift-giving,” “new year goals,” “summer preparation”], include holiday-appropriate calls-to-action, appeal to [specific motivation – e.g., “gift-giving stress,” “self-improvement,” “celebration preparation”], and maintain our brand voice which is [brand personality]. Provide 4 variations: one focused on gift-giving, one on personal benefits, one on family/sharing, and one on urgency. Include recommendations for seasonal visual elements for [platform].

### 3. Pain Point Ad Copy
This prompt creates empathetic ad copy that directly addresses your audience’s specific problems and frustrations. It helps you connect with potential customers by showing you understand their struggles before presenting your solution. Most effective for complex problems, B2B services, or any situation where customers need to feel understood before they’ll consider buying. Use this when you need to break through ad noise by speaking directly to what keeps your target audience up at night.

> The Prompt: I need to create pain point-focused ad copy for [platform] targeting [specific audience]. My [product/service] solves the problem of [main customer pain point]. My target customers typically struggle with [specific daily frustration/challenge] which leads to [negative consequence/feeling]. Create ad copy that: opens with a relatable pain point question or statement that makes them think “that’s exactly my problem,” describes the emotional impact of this problem ([frustration/stress/time waste]), presents our solution as the obvious answer without being pushy, includes social proof element like “[number] customers have solved this problem,” provides a clear next step with [specific CTA], uses language that shows deep understanding of their situation, and maintains a [empathetic/understanding/solution-focused] tone. Generate 3 variations: one that starts with a question, one that starts with a frustrating scenario, and one that starts with a bold statement. Each should be optimized for [platform] and include suggested targeting parameters.

### 4. Discount/Sale Ad Copy
This prompt creates urgency-driven copy that maximizes the impact of your discounts and promotional offers. It balances highlighting savings with maintaining your brand value, ensuring customers feel they’re getting a great deal without making your product appear “cheap”. Use this for flash sales, seasonal clearances, or any promotional campaigns where the discount is the primary motivator.

> The Prompt: I’m creating discount-focused ad copy for a [sale type – e.g., “flash sale,” “seasonal clearance,” “anniversary sale”] on [platform]. We’re offering [specific discount/offer] on our [product category/specific products]. Our target audience is [demographic] who typically [buying behavior/motivation]. Create compelling ad copy that: leads with the discount amount prominently ([percentage/dollar amount off]), creates urgency with time sensitivity ([hours/days left]), includes the original price and sale price for comparison, specifies exactly what’s included in the offer, provides a strong reason for the sale ([anniversary, clearance, holiday]), includes trust elements like [return policy, guarantee, free shipping], ends with a clear call-to-action emphasizing immediate action, and uses trigger words that motivate quick decisions. Generate 4 variations with different urgency levels: high urgency (ending soon), medium urgency (limited time), value-focused (emphasizing savings), and exclusivity-focused (special access). Optimize word count for [platform] and suggest accompanying offer graphics.

### 5. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) Ad Copy
This prompt leverages scarcity and exclusivity to create compelling copy that. It taps into the psychological principle that people value things more when they believe they might lose access to them. Use this for limited-time offers, exclusive access campaigns, or when you have genuine scarcity around your product or service.

> The Prompt: I need FOMO-driven ad copy for [platform] promoting [product/service/event]. My offer is [specific offer/opportunity] catering to [target audience]. The scarcity element is [limited quantity, limited time, exclusive access, limited spots]. Create ad copy that: immediately establishes what they’ll miss if they don’t act ([specific benefit/opportunity]), uses scarcity language authentically without being manipulative, includes specific numbers ([how many left, how much time, how many people]), shows what others are already doing ([number of people who joined/bought]), includes social proof elements ([reviews, testimonials, user counts]), provides clear next steps with time-sensitive CTA, and maintains a [tone] that aligns with our brand. Generate 3 variations: one emphasizing limited quantity, one emphasizing limited time, and one emphasizing exclusive opportunity. Each should include different psychological triggers and be optimized for [platform] with suggested audience targeting based on behavior patterns.

### 6. Feature-Benefit Ad Copy
This prompt transforms technical features into result-focused benefits that clearly communicate value. It helps you bridge the gap between what your product does and why customers should care about those capabilities. Perfect for B2B products, tech services, or any complex offering where features need translation into real-world benefits. Use this when you have feature-rich products that need clearer value communication, or when targeting audiences who need to understand specific capabilities before buying.

> The Prompt: I’m creating feature-benefit ad copy for [platform] highlighting our [product/service]. The key features I want to emphasize are [list 2-3 main features]. My target audience is [specific demographic] who values [what they care about most]. Create ad copy that: transforms each feature into a customer-centered benefit, explains “what this means for you” for each feature, uses language that [target audience] naturally uses, addresses the specific problem each feature solves, includes proof points or specifications where relevant, avoids technical jargon unless [audience] expects it, connects features to emotional outcomes or practical results, and ends with a benefit-focused call-to-action. Structure: lead with the most compelling benefit, support with feature explanation, add credibility with [proof element], close with action step. Generate 3 variations: one focusing on practical benefits, one focusing on emotional benefits, and one focusing on competitive advantages. Optimize for [platform] character limits and include suggestions for visual elements that showcase each feature.

### 7. Social Proof Ad Copy
This prompt leverages the power of social validation to build credibility and trust with potential customers. It communicates your customer success metrics, reviews, and testimonials into persuasive copy that shows others are already benefiting from your solution.

Use this when you have strong social proof but need help presenting it in a compelling way that drives action.

> The Prompt: I need social proof-driven ad copy for [platform] showcasing our [product/service] success. Available social proof includes: [customer count/usage statistics], [review score/rating], [notable customers/companies], [media mentions/awards], and [specific success metrics].

Create ad copy that: leads with the most impressive and relevant social proof number, explains what this proof means for potential customers, includes multiple types of social proof without overwhelming, uses credible and specific statistics ([exact numbers, percentages, timeframes]), addresses potential skepticism with proof-showing details, and includes a trust-building call-to-action. Generate 4 variations emphasizing different social proof types: customer volume/popularity, expert recognition/awards, customer satisfaction/reviews, and proven results/success stories. Each should be optimized for [platform], include suggested proof visuals, and target audience segments most likely to respond to that type of social proof.

## How to Create Your Own Gemini Prompts for Ad Copy
Creating effective ad copy prompts requires giving Gemini specific context about your business, audience, and campaign goals. The more detailed information you provide, the more targeted and useful your generated copy will be.

### Step-by-Step Process:
- Define your platform and format – Specify where the ad will run and any character limits or format requirements
- Describe your business and offering – Include what you sell, your industry, and key differentiators
- Identify your target audience – Be specific about demographics, behaviors, and current situation
- State your CTA objective – Clarify whether you want clicks, conversions, awareness, or other specific actions
- Provide context and constraints – Include brand voice, tone requirements, and any other must-include elements
- Request multiple variations – Ask for different approaches or emphasis points to test
- Specify desired output format – Request organized results with explanations or suggestions for visuals

### Example Prompt Using These Steps:
> I’m creating conversion-focused ad copy for Instagram Stories promoting our meal prep delivery service. We’re a healthy meal delivery company targeting busy professionals aged 25-40 in urban areas of California who struggle with eating healthy due to time constraints. Our main differentiator is chef-designed meals that take under 3 minutes to heat up. The campaign goal is to drive sign-ups for our 7-day trial offer at $39. Create an ad copy that maintains our friendly but professional brand voice, emphasizes convenience and health benefits, includes our “3-minute meal” key feature, and ends with a clear call-to-action to “Start Your Trial.” Generate 3 variations: one focusing on time-saving benefits, one on health outcomes, and one on convenience during busy workdays. Each should be under 25 words and include suggestions for accompanying visuals that would work well in Stories format.

## Conclusion
Gemini excels at understanding psychological triggers, consumer behavior patterns, and proven copywriting structures that drive conversions. Its ability to analyze successful ad formats and apply persuasion principles makes it a great tool for generating compelling copy quickly.

However, the generated copy should always be your starting point, not your final product. You’ll need to proofread carefully and add your unique brand voice, specific phrases your audience knows you for, or small tweaks that make the difference between good copy and great copy.

Start by testing a few of these prompts for your current campaigns, then experiment with different variations as you become comfortable with the process. Keep a document of successful copy versions to reference for future campaigns, and don’t be afraid to combine elements from different prompts to create something unique to your brand.
