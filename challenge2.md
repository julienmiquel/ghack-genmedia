Challenge 2: The Visual Blueprint
[Previous Challenge](link-to-previous-challenge)    [Next Challenge](link-to-next-challenge)

## Introduction
Now that we have our brand guidelines, our protagonist and our narrative, it’s time to create our visuals. This is the storyboard of your ad, which visually shows the flow of your narrative and your protagonist within it.

## Description
First we will create our protagonist. Using Gemini Native Image (aka: Nano Banana), generate a representative image of your protagonist using your description of them and your brand guidelines. Once you have your protagonist images, generate more images that depict the protagonist at different angles (front, side, back, 3/4, etc).

Once you have your protagonist, generate the same set of images for the product.

  > Note
  > Given the limit of 3 images as context when generating videos and images, consider creating a “contact sheet” for the protagonist and product with all images at the various angles together in one image file.

Next, create images for your storyboard visualizing the scenes crafted in the previous challenge. These storyboard images should contain accurate and consistent depictions of the product and protagonist when they are shown.

  > Note
  > These storyboard images will be used in the next challenge and there are multiple ways to reference them. You can use them as start/end frames, you can use them as Subject reference. If you don’t design your storyboard images with that idea or if you don’t use them in the next challenge, you will struggle with the consistency.

We also need a final closing frame that will inform Veo on how to end the video. It should include space for a Cymbal Pod logo and space for the text of the tagline or call to action.

Finally, generate a logo for the Cymbal Pod that conveys the brand.

  > Important
  > The storyboard images must be in 16:9 format because we’ll use them as references for the video clips we’ll create in the next challenge

We’ve already created a storage bucket for you, make sure that all of this work is stored in that bucket, as we’ll use these assets when we compose our final video (copying those images into your document and screenshotting will negatively impact the quality of these images).

## Success Criteria
Multiple consistent images are generated that clearly define the protagonist’s appearance from various angles.

Your coach approves of the visual consistency of your images.
The images are stored in the storage bucket that has been provided to you.

## Tips
If you’re in a squeeze for time, you can parallelize the protagonist, product, and logo generation. You’ll need both product and protagonist contact sheets to start with the storyboard images though.
Keep in mind that some models will have limitations with respect to how many reference images you can include in a prompt and the maximum size. See for example the Technical Specifications for Nano Banana
There are also limits in the Media Studio UI, you might want to use the Import from Cloud Storage options instead of uploading your images in your prompt
