## **1\. Brand Guidelines**

These guidelines define the core identity of the Cymbal Pod, a silent, hovering single-person urban transport vehicle.

| Category | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Aesthetics** | **Neo-Minimalism & Organic Futurism.** The design is defined by smooth, pebble-like forms and a low-profile silhouette that minimizes visual clutter. Surfaces utilize matte, non-reflective finishes (e.g., recycled polymers) for a muted, sophisticated look. Integrated, subtle lighting systems are used instead of harsh external lights. |
| **Values** | **Mindful Mobility:** Moving through the city without disrupting its harmony (silence, zero emissions).   **Urban Harmony:** Seamless integration into the city's ecosystem.   **Personal Sanctuary:** Providing a calm, focused, and intentional travel experience. **Sustainable product management:** inline with current sustainability guidelines  |
| **Mood / Color Palette** | **Mood:** Calm, serene, focused, and sophisticated. The feeling is one of being centered and undisturbed amidst urban chaos. |
| \*\* | **Color Palette:** **Muted & Earthy.** **Mist Gray** (Primary body color, matte finish), **Deep Jade** (Accent for integrated system lighting and UI), **Terra Cotta Accent** (Subtle interior touch for fabric piping or controls), **Soft Linen** (Main interior fabric). |
| **Target Audience** | **The Conscious Urban Professional (28-45).** Tech-savvy, high-earning individuals living in dense urban centers. They prioritize mental well-being, sustainability, and highly efficient use of time. They view their commute as "found time" for reflection or focused work, and value peace and quiet above ostentatious status. |
